ADVANCED_RACES=Advanced Races are rewarded by archons and are:\n\r\
\n\r\
\n\r\
Deva - Earned over great service to a good deity, a greater angel sort.\n\r\
\n\r\
Succubus/Incubus - Achieving questionable yet related things as a `demon` in ways that would get you upgraded to a real sex demon, again it is granted by an archon.\
\n\r\
\n\r\
Intelligent Undead - Much like Liches but weaker, though the person do not need to be a master necromancer, just needs help of a necromancer or have to become an undead and wrangle their control back using their spirit and willpower, and regain themselves in their undead state.\
\n\r\
\n\rSylph - Air specialized-ly ascended nymphs, coming with several elemental related abilities and more potential for beauty-wise growth than regular nymphs too.\
\n\r\
\n\rSynthetic - Robots with independent AI that runs the body, much like any person but potential to upgrade themselves to be better than the organics.\
\n\r\n\rWhite Essence Resurgentis - White essence resurgentis are taled to be from the heritage of the god of death himself, besides the legends they are one in a million among the resurgentis and are often taken as royalty.. or extremely expensive prestigious slaves. They are said to be immune to effects of Mind flayers and resistant to mind effects overall, and have extra affinity to undead magic. They are also known to be very talented in things they do with passion most of the time. All of that comes with being at the target board all the time.\
\n\r\n\rSclerotia - Similiar to Myconid only in the way they are both fungus based, Sclerotia are fungus taken over dead bodies of humanoids that are reanimated in a twisted way such as that. You must die to become this.\
\n\r\n\rXenomorph - Super-evolved alien creatures with acidic bloodstream. Some may be evolved to get along with other beings.

PLOT=Command : PLOT\n\r\
Usage   : PLOT [PLOT MESSAGE]\n\r\

The first of this race were some sort of semi-undead, so it is said. Purple skinned somewhat taller human-like folk with colorful glowing hair and whole eyes, blood, inner walls of genitals and nipples. Both genders of the species can go into some sort of mindless-ish rage when hurt or emotionally angered or saddened, depending on one's self, May end up even killing others or hurting loved ones before snapping-out in bit late realization. (Or hurting self) Though the rage allows them to ignore some pain and push their physical limits\n\r\ \n\r\ Males of species are significantly stronger than Humans while females tend do be still bit stronger but instead more agile, though their larger bodies and their different sort of blood and all make them really bad at maintaining their body tempeature well, and their undead origins (if it is true) do not help with that as the current remaining of the race are very much alive. They have strangely higher libidos to compensate for their really low pregnancy and birth rates as a female can only get pregnant after 5 years of a birth and lose fertility after their 30-35s totally It is a really small window to keep their race from declining to extinction, their libido spike especially more on novembers for some reason, the primary cause of Sector Minus' depravity is the majority of population is made out of Resurgentis, or a more racist term, 'Reaper's as their more cannibalistic groups used to exist before their own race's more sane ones mostly destroyed their groups, but they may still exist somewhere. Since Eating any sort of raw meat or even a corpse like an animal do not sicken or harm them in any way except mentally, as they are still sentient and human-like.\n\r\\n\r\A reaper's color of their hair, eyes and all of those glowing bits listed are called 'essence' as even their blood carry such color, and when their blood pressure is low, the glow dims, and when the life slips out. The glow is completely gone, leaving a non-glowing color of their parts. It is easy to tell how healthy someone of this race is depending on how bright their glow is, and then there is White essenced ones, one in a million or less they are completely immune to mind-control effects and are considered to be of the upper-class compared to all resurgentis due their obvious physical superiority and religious meanings of them. They also tend to be generally more gifted in most cases they are interested in But it also bears weight on slavery, White Essence reapers are a luxury and they are born with a massive target on their backs.\n\r\\n\r\More detailed information and images are in the google docs file for the custom race\n\r\

Slime people are slimes that gained enough sentience and intelligence to communicate in the usual languages and not be mindlessly aggressive like most animals and other slimes, they are called 'people' as they often take on human shapes when coming into contact with other humanoid beings even though they are usually found in glob-like forms as maintaining a certain shape is often difficult over long durations, especially complex humanoid forms. And their lower intelligence overall causes them to learn slower... For one to even talk let alone cast spells will need quite some work.

Thought to be mutated out of radiation, a green.. plant.. thing person rose long ago in the shadow island, in the forest after the apocalypse. Though it was mostly harmless physically, the womanly shaped plant person with narcotic properties captured many survivors in the forest using her control of the wild, and... Used them for..copulation? Producing seeds that helped the forest re-grow after the annihilation of the world. Most of the green of the current post-apocalypse world is thanks to that rapist.. plant lady. 'Blissrose'\n\r\\n\r\Plant people are mostly unable to speak, but are generally harmless as they need not to eat or anything, protective of the forest as they are connected to it, and they are able to control their seeds 'spawn' such as vines, trees or even whole ents if one is powerful as the 'plant mother'... Though almost none should be, Oldest plant person is 500 years old and that is the first one as mentioned. Plant people are -really rare- and it's mostly a random chance one popping up out of another's planted seed instead of some flower or tree that make a forest... They can not reproduce over each other, they need other humanoid races to do that. If you are wondering, usually plant people store water in their 'breast's and their ejaculate is usually nectar of sorts, depending on what sort of plant person it is. Male plantpeople can use other species' females in a strange way, making them produce some seeds in their wombs after about 5 minutes just like how female plantpeople, but male can not store excess water like females and it may become a problem for them fast if they are not in the forest and in a city, but they can always root themselves in the ground in the forest to find some water underground at worst case scenario.\n\r\Generally their appearance is of a green skinned, very light human-like with leaves and vines for hairs and alike, their skin is still plant matter and may be even of wood, or just plant whatevers. They are very diverse in appearance and function but not at the same time.

Generally created by evil gods or born in hell from other demons' or their victims. Tainted at heart generally, rarely any manage to even want to change their ways... Demons may rise to be angels if they take attention of some good deity by showing that they changed for the better... But why should they? Some instead commit more sexually heinous acts and end up being 'promoted' to an incubus or succubus.

SEX_ABILITIES=Sex abilities are special set of abilities created with the purpose of life-stealing over combat sex while often holding your opponent and yourself in a pinned position, Sex abilities are mostly dependant on breeding expertise which is tied to the dexterity stat, some sex abilities also have dirty fighting and grappling sort of expertises aswell.
CLONING=Cloning is a premium service (EXP cost as you die, the restoration prayer cost when you get up and maybe early cloning cost to your friend if that happens.). Cloning allows semi-immortality though mind transferring to a newly cloned body of yours, You will not remember memories leading up to your death if it is caused by another player, PK acts. And most likely most of your last day(or few days) depending on what you want. Clone vats scan for their customers` health status once per hour and if none is detected they will shoot up a new clone and transfer the mind of the customer into the  new body. (it will revive your body in the same room, codedly.) Premium, new model cloning vats that corporate buildings have also shoots up on log-in of any sort.

ADVANCED_CLASSES=Tacticaljoy - Sexual experts that learn many related abilities and even some that are special to some classes, and learn the way to do sexual healing more efficently than most.\n\r\n\rInfiltrator - Above the lowly thieves in the streets, specially trained stealth and CQC (close quarters combat) masters though primarily focused to avoid direct confrontation.

CORPORATE_BRANDS=^bArchercorp^N - Formed by Leonard William Archer. Most likely the oldest corporation to exist, coming from the old world. A weapons and space vessel manufacturer and developing megacorp that build the Space Station Epsilon, still persists to this day. A strangely isolationist corporation.%0D\
%0D\

^cNovamed Corporation^N - WIP. Novamed at first was just a pharmaceutical company that grew into absorbing other corporations into becoming one massive entity and a monopoly in the health sector, produces medicine, medical tools, medical devices and provides related services.%0D\
%0D\
^b1337^N - Formed by a group of unknown individuals in the slums, this `corp` is not really a corporation but mostly a group of nerds attracting more nerds to build some nerd-magic software things that are actually impressive for the small size of this group.

%0D^YScraptech^N - Universal name for all unbranded pre-war or scavenger made slap-together tools and everything included, not really a brand.

%0DLowest wage for any corporate employee is 8 megacredits a month.

SYLPH=<RACE>\
Whimsical and unpredicted like a gust of wind, this race of winged nymphs belonging to the element of air tend to make their homes at the tallest trees or the highest peaks where the air is constantly moving and preferably where storms brew. Fae beings of air, they`re quick and light, but lack mass and strength. They are so rare even the legends about their existence are mostly unheard of. Some claim their beauty surpasses even that of nymphs, others say they`re barely humanoid and more of a chaotic air elemental playing illusions on the minds of unlucky mountaineers. Those who claim to have witnessed one, described them as a gorgeous feminine breeze. Caves, confined places and stale air are the dread of sylphs and long exposure to such will harm them.
PLAYER_HOUSING=If there is a residental area, a suitable place in the wilderness or such spot you want to build a home in? Ask an immortal to make you a room you can expand into, the starting room will require ^c30QP^N OR a alot of ^craw materials^N required for a house and an amount of ^clocal currency^N up to the immortal`s discretion, and it will either have a ^crent or maintenance cost monthly^N like any other player housing, however houses in the no man`s land, which require just upkeep will require much less currency per month.\
^cYou can also ask an immortal to purchase a house to be permanently a characters` for a grand amount of in game money.^N

KIDNAP=Kidnapping rules:\
^N%0D\
^H1.^XWhile the kidnapped person is online, you are required to keep in touch with them, you can not leave them alone in a room for more than a couple hours.\
^N%0D\
^H2.^XYou can not hold a person for longer than 3 days, they must be released or however you are aiming to finish a kidnap, such as murder or so on.\
^N%0D\
^H3.^XYou can not rape a kidnapped character without OOC consent.\
^N%0D\
%0DAdditionally, Kidnapee rules:\
^N%0D\
^H1.^XYou can not recall or use any other non physical, ooc methods to escape confinement.^N\
^N%0D\
^H2.^XYou may contact people if you are able to, including tells if there is nothing stopping neura-link communication in the room.^N\
^N%0D\
^H3.^XYou can not rely on cloning even if you are a corpo, threat of permanent death is very real to your characters, always. Therefore you may be intimidated into doing things while kidnapped, you should roleplay accordingly.^N\
^N%0D%0D^rKeep in mind, before AND after kidnapping and after an escape attempt must all be logged with a PKMAIL to allow staff to keep track of events^N
PKMAIL=^cPKMAIL (text)^N\
%0D%0DYou are required to use PKMAIL before any player-vs-player action, this includes use of see aura spells and everything alike, unless consent is granted by that player for an instance where it would never evolve into something greater, PKMAIL allows staff to keep track of what has happened before and allows justification for actions that would normally make no sense for someone to do, such as nuking a corporate building..?\
%0DThe text should be in a single line, which you write PKMAIL (TEXT) and you will be asked confirmation to send after pressing enter, You may use `% 0 D` without spaces between to create a page break in a single line.\
%0D%0DA PKMAIL should include atleast:\
%0DWho: (include witnesses, even NPC`s that might have seen something)\
%0DWhat: (mugging, killing, kidnapping etc, and outcome.)\
%0DWhen: (time IC and weather if it matters for vision etc, use TIME command)\
%0DWhere: (indoors or outdoors and as specific as meaningful, like phantom city outskirts)\
%0DWhy: (if you are the victim this could be just your guess if you do not know why.)\
%0DHow: including relevant info. any special items used or other important details or anything that happened during the whole pk encounter.\
\n\nTheft and any sort of indirect hostile action is still a PK action.

NOPK=NOPK marked areas prevent playerkilling and all fights in that room and provide a 25% EXP bonus while in the room, for RP gathering encouragement.
DEATHMESSAGES=You may have encountered one gorey, snuffy and maybe worse or better message from a mob you fought and lost to, those are generally happening in dungeons where everyone was warned to be extremely dark and hellish to start. Mobs may have either race-based or name specific death messages that pop up when they kill anything else, expressing their overly perverted and sick nature, and darkening the dungeon atmosphere, making people less likely to wander into dangerous areas, as it should be. Not everyone is cut out to be an adventurer, it requires strong will, strong body and dedication to be one... Or perhaps being sick in the head may result in an adventurer aswell, if lacking will and dedication.\
A party is always good to have, as those dark dungeons are no joke.\
Note: If you died to an ability from a mob, a deathmessage will not trigger.

MYCONID=<RACE>A race of magically gifted mushrooms, A myconid is typically created when a fungus absorbs significant magical energy, allowing for a particular fruiting body to gain sentience. Myconids find themselves without much of a history or culture, but they share a vague togetherness through their shared connection to the invisible mycelial network beneath their feet. Although they can take many forms, most Myconids are at least humanoid in shape, with a mushroom cap topping their round heads.
