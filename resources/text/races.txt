\n\r\n\r^pChoose a race for your character.  Although races are meant primarily for role-playing purposes, there are some significant differences between the several races... Those are the original, non-original or custom races you can select here:^N
^XResurgentis (C) :^.^? Purple skinned, bit taller and stronger humanoids with glowing hair and eyes as their 'essence', main population of Phantom City.
^XMimikin     (C) :^.^? animal ear and tailed humanoids with matching animalistic traits, they are cute trust me. Invoke inner weeb.
^XBeastkin    (C) :^.^? Anthro humanoid people of any kind, the furry choice, probably.
^XKitsune     (C) :^.^? This could be nekomimi, but why not? Kitsune are too cool they get their own race. This is either anthro or mimi-like fox people.
^XSlimeperson (C) :^.^? Unusually intelligent blobs of slimes taking humanoid form most of the time to fit in, still overall less intelligent but enough to talk and be accepted in society as they are no longer trying to mindlessly consume people.
^XInsectoid   (C) :^.^?Giant or maybe even really insect-sized insect-people, probably quite frightening in appearance sometimes. Those are intelligent enough to be reluctantly accepted into some cities and live a human-like life somewhat.
^XPlantperson (C) :^.^? Green plant humanoid people of many kinds that sort of live off water and the sun while for some reason needing other species to create seeds and make their own forest that they control...
^XMyconid     (C) :^.^? A race of magically gifted mushrooms, A myconid is typically created when a fungus absorbs significant magical energy, allowing for a particular fruiting body to gain sentience. Although they can take many forms, most Myconids are at least humanoid in shape, with a mushroom cap topping their round heads.
^XSclerotia   (C) :^.^? Similiar to Myconid only in the way they are both fungus based, Sclerotia are fungus taken over dead bodies of humanoids that are reanimated in a twisted way such as that.
^XXenomorph   (C) :^.^? Super-evolved alien creatures with acidic bloodstream. Some may be evolved to get along with other beings.
\n\r\n\rNote: Undead selections will be your base race, if you want to become another race and be undead version of it, contact an archon after starting as your preferred race.
