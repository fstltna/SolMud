\n\r\n\r^pChoose a race for your character.  Although races are meant primarily for role-playing purposes, there are some significant differences between the several races... You should probably imagine them as they appear in art and all that, less disturbing and stuff cause that's what we like, right? Drows and Elves are not like the D&D ones here... Those are the original or custom races here:^N
^XResurgentis (C) :^.^? Purple skinned, bit taller and stronger humanoids with glowing hair and eyes as their 'essence', main population of Phantom City.
^XMimikin    (C) :^.^? animal ear and tailed humanoids with matching animalistic traits, they are cute trust me. Invoke inner weeb.
^XBeastkin    (C) :^.^? Anthro humanoid people of any kind, the furry choice, probably.
^XKitsune     (C) :^.^? This could be nekomimi, but why not? Kitsune are too cool they get their own race. This is either anthro or mimi-like fox people.
^XSlimeperson (C) :^.^? Unusually intelligent blobs of slimes taking humanoid form most of the time to fit in, still overall less intelligent but enough to talk and be accepted in society as they are no longer trying to mindlessly consume people.
^XInsectoid   (C) :^.^?Giant or maybe even really insect-sized insect-people, probably quite frightening in appearance sometimes. Those are intelligent enough to be reluctantly accepted into some cities and live a human-like life somewhat.
^XPlantperson (C) :^.^? Green plant humanoid people of many kinds that sort of live off water and the sun while for some reason needing other species to create seeds and make their own forest that they control...
^XMyconid (C) :^.^? A race of magically gifted mushrooms, A myconid is typically created when a fungus absorbs significant magical energy, allowing for a particular fruiting body to gain sentience. Although they can take many forms, most Myconids are at least humanoid in shape, with a mushroom cap topping their round heads.
