^HWelcome to @MudInfo?NAME@.^N

Keep in mind this is an Adult Mud with all sorts of themes allowed, and generally NSFW in almost all parts, but you may be and do as you like as long as you can, that is.
Since this is a beta-test mud, we will need as much feedback as you can give us, including all of your gripes, praises, and suggestions if our adventure can improve.
You'll find that the character creation process is rather simple, but that the game itself is as complex and exciting as you make it.  You will be guided wizard-style through each question in creating your character.
