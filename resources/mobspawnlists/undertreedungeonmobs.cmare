^HDesc.     : ^N

Druids are mystical guardians of the natural world, and the wielders of natures grandest powers.  They may not wear metal, and can only use a small set of natural weapons, but their notorious health and magical chants more than make up for this.  Like the natural world, Druids are restricted to a moderate neutral alignment in order for their chants to work reliably.


Druid is the starting point for numerous sub-classes which the player may choose to gain levels in at any time.  These sub-classes include: Delver, Beastmaster, Gaian, Mer, and SkyWatcher.


How to play: The druid is the most complex class to play.  Most of his magic requires the assistance of numerous spells to bear fruit, but the benefits make the complexity well worth it.  The druid is also best fit for travelling with animal armies of his own creation.  In groups, the druid can assist with some extra fire power at high levels.  For the most part though, it is alone that the druid will flourish, forming his own animal groups to make up for his weakness in combat.


Although weak in melee combat, due to equipment and skill limitations, the druid is capable of marshaling all the powers of animals and plants to aid in the vanquishing of foes for experience.  At higher levels, as the powers of weather come into play, the Druid will find their magical prowess unequaled by any other class.</HELP><ESTATS>0|0|0|0|0|0|2147483647|0.0|0|0|0|</ESTATS><ASTATS>0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|7|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|</ASTATS><CSTATS/><ASTATE/><STARTASTATE/><DISFLAGS>0</DISFLAGS><CABILITIES><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_PlantPass</CACLASS><CALEVEL>11</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_Reabsorb</CACLASS><CALEVEL>18</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_FeelElectricity</CACLASS><CALEVEL>5</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_Farsight</CACLASS><CALEVEL>5</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_WaterWalking</CACLASS><CALEVEL>9</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_SenseFluids</CACLASS><CALEVEL>21</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_NaturalBalance</CACLASS><CALEVEL>7</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Scrapping</CACLASS><CALEVEL>20</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Specialization_Natural</CACLASS><CALEVEL>1</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_ControlFire</CACLASS><CALEVEL>8</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Skill_Climb</CACLASS><CALEVEL>1</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>100</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>true</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_IllusionaryForest</CACLASS><CALEVEL>14</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Skill_Write</CACLASS><CALEVEL>1</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>true</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_SenseSentience</CACLASS><CALEVEL>19</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>PUBLIC</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK></CAMASK><CAMAXP>100</CAMAXP></CABILITY><CABILITY><CACLASS>Chant_PlanarAdaptation</CACLASS><CALEVEL>28</CALEVEL><CAPROFF>0</CAPROFF><CAAGAIN>false</CAAGAIN><CASECR>MASKED</CASECR><CAPARM></CAPARM><CAPREQ></CAPREQ><CAMASK>+PLANE

mpecho $n ^rtackles injured $t onto the ground on $S back, inserting it's genital right into $t's pussy and beginning to pump rapidly as it holds $M down with all it's legs and biting on $M as it tries to kill $M. $t screams but soon it stops as $n begins to pump green slimey cum into $M womb then pulls out to cover the motionless $t in it after.
case 3
mpecho $t ^rslumps back on the ground too injured to stand, $n jumps onto $S and inserts it's massive genital into $M mouth and begins to pump rapidly, choking $t with it's size as it does, pumping load after load as time passes, after second load $t was already limp. $n pumps about four loads of green oozy glowing cum into $M stomach and pulls out, complimentarily cumming all over $M face as it steps off.
case 4
mpecho ^r$t ^rslumps on the ground too wounded to fight, $n^r leaps on $t's face, inserting it's large genital into $E eye which causes $t to scream loudly while $n^r begins to pump into the bloody hole as $t squirms and screams, which is soon stopped as $t falls limp, $n^r keeps pumping his fresh new hole for a while before busting a nut into it and pulling out, still dripping oozy green cum from the tip, moving to the other one... Once done busting a second load to the other 'hole' it hops off.^N
case 5
mpecho ^r$n ^rtackles $t and inserts his genital directly into a random wound on $E's torso, rapidly pumping the bleeding hole as $t screams and tries to get $n^r out, with no success. $n^r pumps it's first load into the hole as $t shakes and slowly falls limp. $n^r takes it's time busting atleast three loads in various alternative holes it find on the body before becoming dry of oozy green cum and leaving it alone.^N
