A gifted psionic human. Born in a small town long before the apocalypse, Living with her mom in a rundown house, as her father left long before her birth. Her mother took care of her best she can despite the bad economic situation they were in. Moonbeam always liked the night`s silence and loneliness, the dim comfortable light of her room by the moon and the moon itself. Before bed and the sweet embrace of sleep at last, she would look up at the good old moon every night with it bearing a new face with different `shape` in the sky gazing back at her. Not having any friends her whole life, and those that are around her would mock and hurt her for being ironically lacking in social skills... She didn`t mind it that much. She was alright, The other kids didn`t match her intelligence anyways. 

About when `Moonbeam` is 15 years old, a strong typhoon hits and the house finally gives it`s last breath and crumbles to rubble, the two barely making out of there alive with nothing but the clothes on their backs. They begin to live in the streets and whatever safe-ish alleyway they could find, until the town is hit by a deadly plague when Moonbeam hits 16,  She found out at the executions of the town that it was the doing of some people that offered blood sacrifice to the devil in exchange for immortality or great power, either way the plague was eating at flesh and everything of a person, rotting it from inside out and slowly killing them without a cure, painfully too. Moonbeam and her now older mom, living in the dirt of streets all this time, trying to get some money so they may get another night in an inn`s safety, did last quite an impressive amount of time without catching the plague, or having it be known for so long. 

At the age of 17 Moonbeam`s mother died cause of the disease rotting away her organs, leaving her alone in the world with nobody to rely on, she never got into crime no matter how desperate the times got, then the silence happens, Moonbeam, already diseased midway and in great pain, laying broken and hopeless in a empty, filthy alleyway, Her mind unable to protect or delay what`s to come anymore, with the last of her strength, she shunts her soul into the astral plane, in hopes to buy time but, turns out it will be longer than she planned, her body soon died after her leave, getting more unrecoverable by the second, she was eternally stuck in the astral plane... Her mind, after recovering some of her focus and mental capacity, watched and gazed over the former home of hers, watching it be torn apart, and rot to hell, the ghost town doesn"t stand long, buildings crumble in time, nature take over what it once was it is own until nothing is left of the former land.

Being captivated in the astral plane without a physical form for so long, she had no other option but to try and improve her gift until she can find a way to set herself free, and be alive again. If this could be called death. With no body and no intent to take over someone else`s, she remains a bodiless, astral form taking on an ever-changing cosmic body when she must be seen. Often not speaking, but showing, finding that easier to express herself, her forms often have no mouth, but white glowing wide eyes to take attention, Her most common appearance would be that of a female humanoid shaped pattern of stars and cosmos with flowing hair.

Naming herself `Lady Moonbeam`, as her favorite thing in the world that didn`t leave her, except that is, she left to the astral plane following her body`s death. She then began harvesting the mental energy of the mortals that sleep, as their minds are the most active then, once she reaches a higher understanding of the universe, after her studies from afar in her captivity... Which is no longer, as a wandering consciousness that got her power back and above enough to leave if she wished and did for a while, Finding what's remaining of a dead god with still traces of its mental energy and power still harvestable, which she did. And gathered an even deeper, Maybe horrifying level of understanding of the universe without losing her mind, thanks to her juicy brain and freshly harvested godly power that was of a goddess of pleasure, or something that changed her for the... worse? keeping her sane and intact after the overflow of the said same power. She returned to the astral plane and began building her astral `dreamland` empire out of people`s sweetest dreams... Or wet, whatever pleases the wandering dreamer...&lt;/DESC&gt;&lt;DISP&gt;Lady Moonbeam stands here.&lt;/DISP&gt;&lt;PROP&gt;11|-200|100|100|0|140|500|4.0|135|68|0|&lt;/PROP&gt;&lt;IMG /&gt;&lt;BEHAVES /&gt;&lt;AFFECS /&gt;&lt;FLAG&gt;0&lt;/FLAG&gt;&lt;MONEY&gt;83&lt;/MONEY&gt;&lt;VARMONEY&gt;0.0&lt;/VARMONEY&gt;&lt;GENDER&gt;F&lt;/GENDER&gt;&lt;MRACE&gt;Spirit&lt;/MRACE&gt;&lt;FACTIONS&gt;&lt;FCTN ID="ALIGNMENT.INI"&gt;10000&lt;/FCTN&gt;&lt;FCTN ID="INCLINATION.INI"&gt;-3000&lt;/FCTN&gt;&lt;/FACTIONS&gt;&lt;INVEN /&gt;&lt;ABLTYS /&gt;&lt;CLEREQ&gt;-ALIGNMENT +NEUTRAL +GOOD -EVIL&lt;/CLEREQ&gt;&lt;WORREQ&gt;-ALIGNMENT +NEUTRAL +GOOD -EVIL&lt;/WORREQ&gt;&lt;CLERIT&gt;SAY Bless me Lady Moonbeam&lt;/CLERIT&gt;&lt;WORRIT&gt;SAY Bless me Lady Moonbeam&lt;/WORRIT&gt;&lt;CLERSIT /&gt;&lt;WORRSIT /&gt;&lt;CLERPOW /&gt;&lt;SVCRIT&gt;SAY Bless us Lady Moonbeam&wait 10&wait 10&ALLSAY Amen.&SAY Go in peace&lt;/SVCRIT&gt;&lt;BLESSINGS /&gt;&lt;CURSES /&gt;&lt;POWERS /&gt;</MTEXT><MRIDE /></RMOB><RMOB><MCLAS>GenDeity</MCLAS><MLEVL>1</MLEVL><MABLE>11</MABLE><MREJV>0</MREJV><MTEXT>&lt;NAME&gt;Ultraporn&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;DESC&gt;Avatar is a naked female with clearly feminine features, her breasts are large but slightly larger than proportionate for her frame with small and perky nipples. Her vulva is shaved completely hairless. And her butt is firm and tight but without being big and plump. Unlike natural aromas of sexiness from any other fertilty or sex deities, she emits synthetic pheromones. She seems plastic... hyperreal. That is what the avatar is, but ultraporn itself is another matter. Above regular and everyday porn, ultraporn that appears randomly and in odd places like magic needs special training and biological modifications to even view, and even then only temporarily and for one issue. Without the training, it can easily cause insanity, neurological, and even bizarre physical damage. Some of the Ultraporn religion suggest a forced mass viewing all around the world, so only the trained survive. Although others wish to guard the world from ultraporn while seeking guidance from her, and others wish to enhance their bodies using it. She provides guidance to all who wish to use it however they please.&lt;/DESC&gt;&lt;DISP&gt;Ultraporn stands here.&lt;/DISP&gt;&lt;PROP&gt;11|0|1000|1000|0|1|0|1.0|700|0|0|&lt;/PROP&gt;&lt;IMG /&gt;&lt;BEHAVES /&gt;&lt;AFFECS /&gt;&lt;FLAG&gt;0&lt;/FLAG&gt;&lt;MONEY&gt;0&lt;/MONEY&gt;&lt;VARMONEY&gt;0.0&lt;/VARMONEY&gt;&lt;GENDER&gt;F&lt;/GENDER&gt;&lt;MRACE&gt;Spirit&lt;/MRACE&gt;&lt;FACTIONS&gt;&lt;FCTN ID="ALIGNMENT.INI"&gt;0&lt;/FCTN&gt;&lt;FCTN ID="INCLINATION.INI"&gt;0&lt;/FCTN&gt;&lt;/FACTIONS&gt;&lt;INVEN /&gt;&lt;ABLTYS /&gt;&lt;CLEREQ /&gt;&lt;WORREQ /&gt;&lt;CLERIT&gt;SAY Bless me Ultraporn&lt;/CLERIT&gt;&lt;WORRIT&gt;SAY Bless me Ultraporn&lt;/WORRIT&gt;&lt;CLERSIT /&gt;&lt;WORRSIT /&gt;&lt;CLERPOW /&gt;&lt;SVCRIT&gt;SAY Bless us Ultraporn&wait 10&wait 10&ALLSAY Amen.&SAY Go in peace&lt;/SVCRIT&gt;&lt;BLESSINGS /&gt;&lt;CURSES /&gt;&lt;POWERS /&gt;</MTEXT><MRIDE /></RMOB><RMOB><MCLAS>GenDeity</MCLAS><MLEVL>130</MLEVL><MABLE>11</MABLE><MREJV>500</MREJV><MTEXT>&lt;NAME&gt;Lamashtu&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;DESC&gt;Mother of Monsters and demon-goddess of family.

After the Holy War which created the universe out of it's ashes and fire. wishing to consume other gods' power so one of them may become the sole god of everything and all, eventually, grand grand grand.. so on children of those gods, After only a handful of the ancient gods being left, their essence, power and blood painting the universe, but also being imbued into their personal weapon, or some personal item. Therefore whatever they are god of will not disappear even if they do. The newer gods all mostly left heaven and it's endless war into the newly created mess that is the universe. Finding places with mortals to hide among from the more warmonger gods. Countless years later, at earth at the civilized age. News of a person in black wielding the sword of the first death god, an obsidian-like unbreakable blade that cuts through any material, including souls of it's victims, out for sacred blood, bearing black wings of shadow as the fearsome god-killer is out to end and prevent all of that madness from repeating itself, using madness. Slaying and consuming the powers and collecting weapons of those of the more unpolite newer and ancient gods... Eventually retiring and disappearing, where unknown.

Killing other gods solely because they are cocky, or even just for being annoying to them. Generally careless if someone is good or bad, self-centered. It's said they forced Goddess of Life in blade-point to give life to his undead creations, making an abomination at first.. half undead half living beings that gave birth to fully living 'resurgentis' in time.&lt;/DESC&gt;&lt;DISP&gt;Last Death God's avatar stands here.&lt;/DISP&gt;&lt;PROP&gt;11|-320|140|140|0|140|500|5.0|143|69|0|&lt;/PROP&gt;&lt;IMG /&gt;&lt;BEHAVES /&gt;&lt;AFFECS /&gt;&lt;FLAG&gt;0&lt;/FLAG&gt;&lt;MONEY&gt;120&lt;/MONEY&gt;&lt;VARMONEY&gt;0.0&lt;/VARMONEY&gt;&lt;GENDER&gt;M&lt;/GENDER&gt;&lt;MRACE&gt;Shadow&lt;/MRACE&gt;&lt;FACTIONS&gt;&lt;FCTN ID="ALIGNMENT.INI"&gt;-2999&lt;/FCTN&gt;&lt;FCTN ID="INCLINATION.INI"&gt;-10000&lt;/FCTN&gt;&lt;/FACTIONS&gt;&lt;INVEN /&gt;&lt;ABLTYS /&gt;&lt;CLEREQ /&gt;&lt;WORREQ /&gt;&lt;CLERIT&gt;SAY Bless me The Last Death God&lt;/CLERIT&gt;&lt;WORRIT&gt;SAY Bless me The Last Death God&lt;/WORRIT&gt;&lt;CLERSIT /&gt;&lt;WORRSIT /&gt;&lt;CLERPOW /&gt;&lt;SVCRIT&gt;SAY Bless us The Last Death God&wait 10&wait 10&ALLSAY Amen.&SAY Go in peace&lt;/SVCRIT&gt;&lt;BLESSINGS /&gt;&lt;CURSES /&gt;&lt;POWERS /&gt;</MTEXT><MRIDE /></RMOB><RMOB><MCLAS>GenDeity</MCLAS><MLEVL>150</MLEVL><MABLE>11</MABLE><MREJV>500</MREJV><MTEXT>&lt;NAME&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;DESC&gt;The Wanderer is the God of the Desert, the Nomad king of the tribes.   He once ruled it as a mortal guiding the lost souls that called the desert home to his walls and away from the monsters that roam its sands.  Now he is a massive masculine being of shadow clothed in a desert storm weaved into a cloak, the only features under hood are a pair of glowing blue eyes.

The aspects of the Wanderer are simple, The Desert is cruel and Dangerous so take his cloak of sands and shelter from the storms, The Sun is unyielding in it's dominance so drink his blood so that you may travel to your destination, The Darkness tries to decieve travelers so look for his beacon a top the horizon so that you may never lose your way.

Before his acension to godhood the wanderer was a blind human, gifted with astral sight which he used to guide his tribe through the desert.  He grew to lead the tribe completely as he never lost his way in the eternal dunes, more and more flocked to him as he found water when all was dry and shelter when the sands flew.  Eventualy he held complete dominance over all the desert tribes and formed Crater city, a place for all nomads to come and rest from the harsh deserts.  His death by what most assume to be natural causes along with his near diefication by his followers lead him to accend to the astral plane as the god of the desert where he has watched over all who dwell there, even as evil creeps into his domain.&lt;/DESC&gt;&lt;DISP&gt;The towering form of the Wanderer stands here&lt;/DISP&gt;&lt;PROP&gt;11|-350|150|150|0|150|500|6.0|230|120|0|&lt;/PROP&gt;&lt;IMG /&gt;&lt;BEHAVES /&gt;&lt;AFFECS /&gt;&lt;FLAG&gt;0&lt;/FLAG&gt;&lt;MONEY&gt;149&lt;/MONEY&gt;&lt;VARMONEY&gt;0.0&lt;/VARMONEY&gt;&lt;GENDER&gt;M&lt;/GENDER&gt;&lt;MRACE&gt;Spirit&lt;/MRACE&gt;&lt;FACTIONS&gt;&lt;FCTN ID="ALIGNMENT.INI"&gt;0&lt;/FCTN&gt;&lt;FCTN ID="INCLINATION.INI"&gt;0&lt;/FCTN&gt;&lt;/FACTIONS&gt;&lt;INVEN /&gt;&lt;ABLTYS /&gt;&lt;CLEREQ /&gt;&lt;WORREQ /&gt;&lt;CLERIT&gt;SAY Bless me The Wanderer&lt;/CLERIT&gt;&lt;WORRIT&gt;SAY Bless me The Wanderer&lt;/WORRIT&gt;&lt;CLERSIT /&gt;&lt;WORRSIT /&gt;&lt;CLERPOW /&gt;&lt;SVCRIT&gt;SAY Bless us The Wanderer&wait 10&wait 10&ALLSAY Amen.&SAY Go in peace&lt;/SVCRIT&gt;&lt;BLESSINGS /&gt;&lt;CURSES /&gt;&lt;POWERS /&gt;</MTEXT><MRIDE /></RMOB></ROOMMOBS><ROOMITEMS /></ROOMCONTENT></AROOM>
