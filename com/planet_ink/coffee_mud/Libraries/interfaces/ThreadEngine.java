/**
 * Low level task and thread management system, which contains its own
 * internal respect for the "thread group id" system used by CoffeeMud.
 * This is where all repeating things are scheduled, and new tasks
 * launched.
 *
 * A Tick is a global unit of time, usually 4 seconds.
 * A Ticker or TickClient is an object that receives cpu time,
 * usually every Tick, and gives that time to a Tickable.
 * A Tickable is a normal common CoffeeMud object, such
 * as a mob or item, that needs cpu time.
 * A Tick Group is a collection of Tickers that, for
 * efficiency, tick in a sequence, but at the
 * same rate (usually once per Tick).
