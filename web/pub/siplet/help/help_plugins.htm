<DIV ID="HELPROOT">
<h3>Plugins</h3>
An <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Plugin')">Plugin</a> is a collection of
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Timers')">Timers</a>, 
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Aliases')">Aliases,</a>,
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Triggers')">Triggers</a>, Menus, 
and a special javascript Script that can receive and respond to special
events.  A plugin is represented as a large JSON document.
<P>
Like other editors, you can add or remove global plugins from the 
Global Options/Plugins menu, or plugins that apply only 
to the active mud window's phonebook entry through the Window/Plugins menu.
<P>
You can load a new plugin from your local filesystem by clicking 
the file button.
<P>
The top list field in the Plugin editor allows you to select one of your
existing plugins to review, edit, or delete.  You can also select to Add
a New plugin, which will permit you to enter enter one by hand, or click
the build button to compose one based on your existing Global triggers,
aliases, MXP elements, and timers. 
<P>
When editing or creating a plugin, the first text area is for the plugin 
JSON definition, while the second text area is for the plugin JavaScript handling code.
Consult the <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Plugin')">Plugin</a>
help for the proper syntax of the add plugin and javascript text areas.  You
can share your plugin work at any time using the download button to save 
the plugin json definition to your local filesystem.
<P>
When entering a plugin definition or the javascript code by hand, the appropriate 
text area will turn red and stay red until the document meets minimal requirements, 
or if it has any errors.  When one of the 
text areas is red, you can hover over the little ? help button to the left of it to
see the specific problem, or click on the help button to pull up the full help file.
