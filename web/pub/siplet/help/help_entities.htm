<DIV ID="HELPROOT">
<h3>Entities and <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Mxp')">MXP</a> Elements Editor</h3>
An Entity is both a special variable that can be used in scripts, and an html
entity that a is often used as an escape sequence for reserved characters, but
which Siplet can use to substitute any of the defined variable values.
<P>
Like other editors, you can customize your global Entities from the 
Global Options/Entities menu, or customize the Entities that apply only 
to the active mud window's phonebook entry through the Window/Entities menu.
<P>
The top list field in the Entities editor allows you to either begin adding a new
entity, or editing or deleting an existing one from the list.  When adding or 
editing an entry, Red fields will denote those with invalid or missing data. 
Changes to an Entity will not be submitted so long as a Red field exists. The fields are
as follows:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Name: The unique name of your Entity/Variable.  If a phonebook entity name collides with 
a global entity name, then the phonebook one will be preferred.</LI>
<LI>Value: The stored value of that variable.
</UL>
<h3><a href="javascript:menuHelp('Mxp')">MXP</a> Elements Editor</h3>
The <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Mxp')">MXP</a> Elements field is a place to enter MXP tags, especially &lt!ELEMENT tags and definitions 
that either override those from existing muds, or add new functionality.  This document
is applied whenever a new Siplet window is opened, and not even another secure tag from 
the mud can override them.  If you are logged into a mud with MXP enabled, the Load
button can be used to fill in all of the non-standard element definitions, giving you an
idea of the kind of elements that your mud will send.  The MXP editor must be empty for
the Load button to be visible.
