<I>The GMCP protocol definition can be found at:
<a href="https://tintin.mudhalla.net/protocols/gmcp/">https://tintin.mudhalla.net/protocols/gmcp/</a></I>
<P>
GMCP packets consist of a command (package) and a json document with arguments or parameters.
The base protocol defines only the Core package, and leaves others to emergence in the community.
<P>
<H3>Internal GMCP Packages:</H3>

<B>Core</B><BR>
<pre>
Core.Hello
Core.Supports.Set [string, string, ...]
Core.Supports.Add [string, string, ...]
Core.Supports.Remove [string, string, ...]
</pre>
This is the basic package that all GMCP implementors must respect.  It negotiates what packages
are available in common between the client and server.  Each string in the arguments above
is the name of a package followed by a space and its version number.
<P>
<B>Client.Media</B><BR>
<pre>
Client.Media.Load {name|file: ,tag: ,url: }
Client.Media.Play {name|file: ,tag: ,type: ,url: ,volume: ,loops: ,priority: }
Client.Media.Stop {name|file: ,tag: ,type: }
</pre>
This module is for caching, playing, and stopping audio or video type media.  Only
the audio media is supported at present.
<P>
<B>Client.Login</B><BR>
<pre>
Client.Login.Default {type: "password-credentials"}
Client.Login.Response {user: ,password: }
Client.Login.Credentials {name|file: ,tag: ,type: }
</pre>
This module is logging into a server with credentials.  The type of credentials 
is sent by the server using the Default command, and the client sends those
credentials using Credentials, to which the server responds with Response.
