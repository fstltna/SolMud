<I>The MSP protocol definition can be found at:

<P>
MSP are completely inline commands for instructing the client to play sound media.

<H3>Command Format:</H3>

<pre>
!!MUSIC(filename V=volume L=repeats C=continue T=url P=priority)
!!SOUND(filename V=volume L=repeats C=continue T=url P=priority)
</pre>
MSP is extremely simple.  The filename is the name of the sound file, e.g. "sound.wav",
while volume and priority are numbers from 0-100.  Continue (not supported here) is 0
or 1, while the url is the web location that the sound can be downloaded fromm, e.g.
"http://coffeemud.net/sounds/". If the filename is the word "off", then it will stop playing.
