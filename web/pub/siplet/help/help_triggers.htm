<h3>Triggers</h3>
An Trigger is a rule that is triggered by matching the text that comes from 
a mud and appears in a connected window.  Matching rules can then 
trigger some special <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Actions')">Action</a>.
<P>
Like other editors, you can customize your global Triggers from the 
Global Options/Triggers menu, or customize the Triggers that apply only 
to the active mud window's phonebook entry through the Window/Triggers menu.
<P>
The top list field in the Triggers editor allows you to either begin adding a new
trigger, or editing or deleting an existing one from the list.  When adding or 
editing an entry, Red fields will denote those with invalid or missing data. 
Changes to an Trigger will not be submitted so long as a Red field exists. The fields are
as follows:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Name: The unique name of your Trigger.  If a phonebook trigger name collides with 
a global trigger name, then the phonebook one will be preferred.</LI>
<LI>Pattern: The pattern that must match the plain mud text for the 
action to be taken.  The pattern may be a 
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Regex')">Regular Expression</a> or a simple
string that matches the the mud output. All trigger patterns
are case-insensitive, and &amp;match1;, &amp;match2;, may be used in the action
argument to add in capture group strings from regular expressions.</LI>
<LI>Run Once: When checked, a trigger will only run its action one time, and then disable it.  
<LI>Action: The <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Actions')">Action</a> to take when the trigger matches.  
<LI>Allowed: A special javascript expression that must evaluate to true before this 
match will even be attempted, with the purpose being to establish that the window is in a 
proper state to match the trigger. Putting <pre>win.isConnected()</pre> is default, and simply makes
sure that the connection for the current window is active.  Other useful values include
<pre>win.pb && win.pb.user</pre> to only apply to windows tied to a full 
phonebook entry.  See help on the useful variables in <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Scripts')">Scripts</a> for
more information.
